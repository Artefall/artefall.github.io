Leon was sitting at the couch in front of the window of the living room. The day has came to the end, so only few **sunbeams** slid into apartment, **highligting** a teapot with a second **infusion** of chineese tea.

"Bottoms up," striked trhough Leons head. He filled an empty cup gently and started drinking tea looking trhough the window. 

Leon's apartment were at the very end of the street. The window in the living room was aligned at the center, perpendicular to street. It was amusing for Leon to peer across the end of the street, staring to the dot, were nothing specific could be **made out**.

Last sunbeam passed. Crumbled walls on **delipidated** houses outside were less noticable.
