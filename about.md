                <p>
                    Welcome to my personal web-page! My name is Artem Maksymov. I was born in Odessa, Ukraine, in august of 2002.
                    I got into IT when I was 14 years old, when I started to learn C++. 
                    After graduating school, I decided to study at computer college. I had graduated college after 4 years of studying.
                    Now I'm working as DevOps engineer in Odessa and studying at technical university.
