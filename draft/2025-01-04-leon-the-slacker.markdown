**VIEWERS DISCRETION IS ADVICED: This novel is just a giant self-insert**


Leon sits at the couch in front of the window of the living room. The day has came to the end. Few sunbeams slide into apartment, highligting a teapot with a second infusion of chineese tea.

\*Bottoms up\*. He fills an empty cup gently and starts drinking tea looking trhough the window. 

Leon's apartment are at the very end of the street. The window in the living room is aligned at the center, perpendicular to street. It was amusing for Leon to stare at the dot at which the street perspective converged. 

"At some point it feels like you are the one who's being observed..."

Last sunbeam passes. Crumbled walls on delipidated houses outside are less noticable now. 
The rain started. Some kids and adolscents went out to play with a puddles. Now they are running home because rain revved up to be unbearable. It was to heavy. 

It has been raining for hours.

Someone knocks the door. Leon don't even blink on it.

Knocks are constant now and getting heavier and heavier with every second. Leon tense up.

Five seconds of silense ends with massive hit sound. Intermittent hits are so intensive, the door hinges start crackling. Someone defiently ramed the door with a leg.

"I'm on my way! Stop!"

Leon opens the door. The woman has been standing in front of the opened door. She has drenched to the last thread.

"Finally. Leon, may I stay here till the rain will end? Please..."

Leon is standing, unable to say anything. He is not able to refuse. He concedes and nods his head.

- "Come in. Just so you know, you act absolutely terr..."
- "Thanks, " lady goes to the living room. She put her purse on the kitchen table.

- "What a stench here? Why everything is so dirty? And you hair is so greasy! Solitude doesn't affect you well".

Leon have lost any sense of answering her ridicules and pricks. He decides to go back on the sofa to proceed doing what he has been doing earlier. 

Leon takes another cup of tea. Just trying not to pay attention on a guest. For this special "event" Leon uses his special "use it in a pinch" tea. Every time he drinks it, he feels like the whole world passes him by, letting him concentrate on his sole only. Apparently, it is a very bad idea to concentrate on yourself when environment and the weather outside doesn't contribute to this. But not for Leon. Everytime he's distcracted from contemplation, he tends to go back as soon as possible. This need appeared to be essential for the last period...

"Hahaha! Is he? ," loud laughter brought him out of his thoughts.

Leon turned back and saw 

"Amely..."

"And what she's doing here?"<br>
"We have no place to stay"<br>
"And when do you want to leave?"<br>
"Does it matter?"<br>
"Yes. It does. I'm freaking tired and I want to rest"<br>
"Tired? You sit on a couch for eternity. How can you even get tired? Don't you even happy to see me?"<br>
"I'm tired. You make me feel nerveous" Leon gets stressed.<br>
"Ok. Don't worry. Our train departure at 8AM. We just need to pass this night and We won't bother you anymore. The metro is closed."<br>
"Where do Amely lives?"<br>
"The East Side"<br>
"The suburbs, so... I can call a taxi..."<br>
"No, no need for taxi"<br>
"Why?"<br>
"No need. We already here, we want to party! Long time I haven't <br>
seen her!"<br>
"Why can't you just stay at her home? I'll pay the taxi."<br>
"Here father won't let me in"<br>
"..."<br>
"Please, let us stay here"<br>




"People are getting more and more angry. Everyone is so ruthless."<br>
"And yourself?"<br>
"..."<br>
"Oh, don't you think he will..."<br>
"Yes. Me too."<br>
"So, why are you so dissapointed about it?"<br>

"I was looking for a job and..."<br>
"Then I find a job"<br>
"And heavens knows I'm miserable now"<br>
"..."

"I'm still bringing in new students to my school."

"You are always being grumpy, sullen and gloomy when I feel up to have party! Come on! Where is old Leon you used to be? You used to be like that only to the end of the party! Okay, everybody is getting older, okay, you are getting tired, but now it's just ubearable! Whenever someone ask you to come out or to have fun - you throw some miserable justification "oh, I don't feel like", "I have a job". "

"I'm leaving this place in september. You won't see me here anymore"


**I quit smoking.**

"You always say that human being is just a flesh automaton animated by neurotransmitters. So what happened? "

"Or you want to know how I felt after every hangover? "
