        <h1>Tom Maksymov</h1>

        <p>Hello. My name is Artem, but people usually call me Tom.</p>
  
        <p>I have a background in Software Engineering and three years of experience in IT, where I focused on problem-solving, systems thinking, and technical troubleshooting. After moving to the U.S., I shifted toward hands-on technical work and began developing practical skills across several trades.</p>
  
        <p>I completed a structural welding program and earned a D1.1 certification, gaining experience with tools, fabrication, equipment setup, and blueprint reading. I also worked as an awning installer, where I strengthened my field installation skills, job-site coordination, and ability to work safely in real-world environments.</p>
  
        <p>Currently, I am studying HVAC and electrical wiring, and I hold an EPA 608 Universal Certification. I’m comfortable working with mechanical systems, electrical components, and technical diagnostics, and I enjoy roles where both physical work and problem-solving are involved.</p>
  
        <p>I’m looking for opportunities where I can support field operations, assist with maintenance and repairs, and continue building long-term technical expertise.</p>
