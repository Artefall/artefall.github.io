        <h1>Tom Maksymov</h1>
        
        <p>Hello. My name is Artem, but people usually call me Tom.</p>

        <p>I graduated from a computer college in Ukraine with a diploma in Software Engineering. After working in IT for three years, I realized I’m most fulfilled when I combine mental and physical work. I enjoy solving complex problems, but I also like working with my hands and seeing real-world results.</p>
        
        <p>When I moved to the U.S., I decided to explore the trades. I completed a welding course and earned a D1.1 structural welding certification, which gave me practical experience in fabricating and installing metal structures.</p>
        
        <p>I also began working as an awning installer, gaining hands-on experience with tools, field installation, teamwork, and job-site coordination.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I am studying HVAC and electrical wiring, and I have obtained my EPA 608 Universal Certification, allowing me to work safely with refrigerants and HVAC systems.</p>
        
        <p>I’m looking for opportunities where I can contribute real value, stay hands-on, and continue learning.</p>
