        <h1>Artem Maksymov</h1>
        <p>I lived in Ukraine until the age of 21. I moved to the U.S. through the Uniting for Ukraine program.</p>

        <p>Back in Ukraine, I graduated from a technical college with a degree in software development. I workeTod in IT for three years but realized that purely intellectual work doesn’t suit my character — I need to balance it with something hands-on.</p>

        <p>So, when I arrived in the U.S., I enrolled in the shortest available course at a local college — welding. I wanted to get started with physical work as soon as possible.<p>

        <p>Now I’m looking to grow in a field that combines both mental and physical work — something like electrical work, HVAC, or BAS (Building Automation Systems).<p>

        <p>Nice to meet you!</p>
